    <p class="aboutProject">
      My latest project was for Bob Peiser, an accountant in the Springdale, AR area.  The goal of this site is to bring awareness to his business and build client base.  From a business perspective I learned a great deal about SEO and strategic placement of CTAs.  From a code perspective I used Sass for the first time, and I did not rely on any CSS frameworks to provide the animation for the buttons that appear when the user scrolls down the page.  I used JQuery for the animations, and this taught me a great deal of how Javascript and JQuery interact with the DOM.<br><br>I also tested the site across mulitple browsers including Firefox, Opera, and Safari.  I learned that JQuery does not activate on either Firefox or Opera, unless the opening JQuery function is $(document).ready(function(){}); as opposed to the abbreviated $(function(){});.<br><br>  I am still fighting a bug on the iPhone that makes the page have a gap on the right side of the screen though all of my CSS widths are set to make the sections fill the page.  The reason for the gap is because iOS makes a provision for the scroll bar.  I used Stack Overflow to determine that this can be fixed by amending the html & body CSS tags to include "overflow-x: hidden", but this caused scrolling to be extremely choppy.  Further research indicated that "-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch" could be included with "overflow-x: hidden" to create smooth scrolling, but this caused parts of the page background to go dark.  I decided to put the page in production while I am still working on this issue, and I hope to have an update soon.

      I was asked to build this site for Macy's Glass out of Neosho, MO. This shop has been in business for 30 years, and this is their first website. I was happy to be able to help the business reach more customers by having an online presence.
