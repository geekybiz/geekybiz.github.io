      I was asked to build this site for Macy's Glass out of Neosho, MO. This shop has been in business for 30 years, and this is their first website. I was happy to be able to help the business reach more customers by having an online presence.

      I was a part of a team of 5 that was tasked with rebuilding the DevMountain queue. This app is an integral part of of DevMountain as it facilitates the mentor-student program as well as gives administrators the ability to view students' progress.
