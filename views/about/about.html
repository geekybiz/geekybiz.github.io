    Hi. I'm Nate.
  </h3>

  <p class="aboutMe">
    Born in California, raised on a farm in the Midwest, I have had a variety of experiences before diving into the wonderful world of web development. Graduating with a MBA from the University of Arkansas allowed me to pursue a career with General Mills
    (Cheerios, anyone?) for the past 5 years. Over the past 3 years I began teaching myself to code, but could never stay as consistent as necessary to master the skill set. This led me to Provo, UT to attend an immersive web-development program at DevMountain.
    Development is a valuable skill set that is shaping the world as we know it, and I'm glad to be a part of it.

    <p class="interests">
      Aside from coding, I love snowboarding, crossfit, and my family (not necessarily in that order).  Feel free to hit me up!
